# Animatron
A utility to help initialize animators, transitions, and states for the Unity 3D game engine.

Are you tired of tediously clicking in the animator to generate transitions? Are you tired of unchecking write defaults and turning off the looping of animations? Wouldn't it be great if you could generate animators or clips by setting a couple of parameters? Then Animatron is the product for you!
